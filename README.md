# Speech-based Depression Detection Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning approach for detecting depression through speech analysis, exploring various feature extraction techniques and classification methods.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development
- `src/`: Source code for data processing, feature extraction, and modeling
- `tests/`: Unit tests for project components
- `results/`: Saved models, figures, and performance metrics

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Feature Extraction Techniques
- MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
- Log Mel Spectrogram
- PWP (Pitch-based Wavelet Peaks)

## Methodology
1. Data Collection
2. Feature Extraction
3. Clustering Analysis
4. Model Training and Evaluation

## Running the Project
```bash
python main.py
```

## Notebooks
Refer to the `notebooks/` directory for step-by-step analysis:
- `01_data_exploration.ipynb`
- `02_feature_extraction.ipynb`
- `03_clustering_analysis.ipynb`
